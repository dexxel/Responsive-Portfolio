                        My name is Alex Bakilin. I am 28 years old, 10 years ago I moved with my family from Russia to USA. During this time a lot has changed I got married, 
                        had children, and changed many job duties. 
                        I met many good friends, colleagues, and people. I love my whole family: my wife Alena, daughter Sofia, and soon I will have another baby girl Emma. 
                        I’m very interested in everything that has to deal with computers and technology. 
                        I remember when I was younger I would always pick at the computers and programs. This taught me and gave experience in many things about computers and technology. 
                        As a web developer I am not very experienced, but this is what I want to do. 
                        I really want to learn and progressively grow into a web developer and subsequent professions. See you soon!)
